Magma is yet another set of tools for game development in C.
<br><br>

# Building from source:
## Windows:
You would need [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with both MSVC and the Windows SDK installed.
### Generating the project files:
Magma uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) for project generation. On Windows run:
```bash
.\tools\premake5\premake5.exe vs2022
```
### Building the project:
All you have to do is open `Magma.sln` generated by premake, then build it using Visual Studio.<br>
However, if you want to build in a non-GUI way, you can set up your path environment variable to use `MSBuild.exe`. So now you can run:
```bash
MSBuild Magma.sln
```

### Running the sandbox:
Magma comes with a simple example to make sure it's working, if compilation was successful, you will find the output executable as `bin/Release/sandbox.exe`. You can execute this from CLI using:
```bash
.\bin\Release\Sandbox.exe
```

## Linux:
> NOTE: This has been tested on Arch Linux only, please report any bugs if you encounter any on other linux distrobutions.<br>
> Another NOTE: Please make sure you have Xorg installed, if you're on Wayland you can use Xwayland.

#### Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel premake vulkan-devel libegl xorg-server
yay -S spirv-cross # or paru
```

### Generating the project files:
We will generate the project files as Makefiles.
```bash
./generate.sh
```

### Building the project:
For this, you can use the Makefiles generated by premake, just run:
```bash
make
```

### Running the sandbox:
If compilation was successful, you can find the sandbox executable at `bin/Release/sandbox`. Run using:
```bash
./bin/Release/Sandbox
```
